             <p>My name is Farrah. I live just outside of Fredericton NB; although I called Calgary AB my home for
                 a good part of my life. I am a Market Manager for a popular paint manufacturing company - 
                 having been in the industry for too many years. I recently decided to go back to doing 
                 something that I loved as a young adult and that is coding! I am excited to say that I'm a Full 
                 Stack Web Development Student taking part in a Coding Bootcamp hosted by the University of New Brunwsick.
               <br><br>
                My hobbies include anything outdoors and learning ways to be self-sustainable. I also enjoy 
                anything related to design. I've been selling my crochet pattern designs on Etsy since 2009 and also 
                     own and manage an online clothing store.
                     <br><br>
                
                To sum things up, I am a coder from the past learning new skills and I can't wait to put that knowledge to use. And that is exciting!</b>
