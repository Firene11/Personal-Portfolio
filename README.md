# Personal-Portfolio

## Description
This challenge was created for boot camp students to use HTML and CSS to build a portfolio page. The page includes the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them. 

When you click on links in the navigation, the UI scrolls to the corresponding section. When you click on the link to the section about their work, the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications. The developer's first application's image is larger in size than the others. When you click on the images of the applications you aretaken to that deployed application. When you resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices, you are presented with a responsive layout that adapts to your viewport.
