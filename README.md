# Personal-Portfolio

## Description
My challenge as a boot camp student was to use HTML and CSS to build a portfolio page. The page includes my name, a recent photo, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me. 

When you click on links in the navigation, the UI scrolls to the corresponding section. When you click on the link to the section about my work, the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of my applications. My first application's image is larger in size than the others. When you click on the images of my applications you are taken to that deployed application. When you resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices, you are presented with a responsive layout that adapts to your viewport.
